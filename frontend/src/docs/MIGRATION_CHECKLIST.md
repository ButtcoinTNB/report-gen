# TypeScript Migration Checklist

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation
- [x] Created `MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` with comprehensive plan for gradual elimination of hybrid objects
- [x] Created `TYPESCRIPT_MIGRATION_TOOLS.md` documenting all tools and utilities created
- [x] Added detailed JSDoc comments to components and functions

### Tools and Utilities
- [x] Created snake_case to camelCase utilities in `adapters.ts`
- [x] Implemented interface generator script for automatically creating camelCase interfaces
- [x] Created ESLint rule for detecting snake_case property access
- [x] Implemented snake_case usage analyzer with HTML report generation
- [x] Added npm scripts for running the tools

### Components
- [x] Updated `DocumentUpload.tsx` component with proper TypeScript definitions
- [x] Updated `LoadingIndicator.tsx` component with improved type safety
- [x] Properly typed `ReportPreview.tsx` component
- [x] Updated `AdditionalInfo.tsx` component with proper type definitions
- [x] Fixed `GenerateReport.tsx` page to use camelCase consistently

### Services
- [x] Updated `ReportService.ts` with proper adapter pattern implementation
- [x] Ensured consistent use of adapters across all API services
- [x] Fixed type definitions for API requests and responses
- [x] Standardized error handling with proper types

### Configuration
- [x] Updated ESLint configuration to use custom rules
- [x] Added ESLint plugin configuration

## Tasks Requiring Attention

These items may need attention in future iterations:

### Ongoing Migration
- [ ] Progressively remove hybrid objects as described in the migration strategy
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings to hybrid object creation functions
- [ ] Schedule complete removal of snake_case support

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for adapter functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for components with the adapter pattern
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for edge cases in type conversions

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update main README with information about TypeScript conventions
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines for TypeScript code style
- [ ] Document the timeline for complete snake_case removal

### Additional Tools
- [ ] Extend ESLint rules to cover more TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Integrate snake_case checking into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create automated conversion tools for legacy code

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Eliminate Redundant Types**: Some types are defined in multiple places. Consider consolidating them.

2. **Strengthen Strict Mode**: Update `tsconfig.json` to enable stricter type checking:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "strict": true,
       "noImplicitAny": true,
       "strictNullChecks": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Type Guards**: Implement type guards for better runtime type safety.

4. **Generic Components**: Make more use of generics in component definitions for better reusability.

5. **Monitor Migration Progress**: Use the snake_case analyzer regularly to track progress.

## Next Steps

1. Run the snake_case analyzer to get a baseline of current usage
2. Schedule the migration phases according to the timeline in `MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
3. Start with high-impact, frequently used components first
4. Add ESLint to CI/CD to prevent new snake_case usage
