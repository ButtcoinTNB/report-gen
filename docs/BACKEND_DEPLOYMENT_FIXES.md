# Backend Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the issues encountered during deployment of the backend services to Render, along with their solutions.

## Import Issues

### Problem: Missing Type Definition (`UploadQueryResult`)

The deployment was failing with the following error:
```
NameError: name 'UploadQueryResult' is not defined
```

This error occurred in the `backend/api/upload.py` file because:
1. The `UploadQueryResult` class was used in the response model annotation for the `/query` endpoint
2. But the import for this class was missing or incorrect

### Solution:

1. **Ensure proper import**: We verified that `UploadQueryResult` is properly defined in `backend/api/schemas.py`
2. **Fix the response structure**: Updated the `/query` endpoint to return data that matches the `UploadQueryResult` model structure:
   ```python
   return {
       "status": "success",
       "data": {
           "upload_id": created_query["query_id"],
           "filename": file.filename,
           "status": "completed",
           "progress": 100.0,
           "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
       }
   }
   ```

## Path and Module Resolution

### Problem: Module Imports Not Resolving Correctly

When deploying to Render, Python modules weren't resolving correctly because:
1. The service was starting from a different directory than expected
2. Relative imports weren't working as intended in production

### Solution:

1. **Update start command**: Changed the Render start command to:
   ```
   cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
   Using `python -m` ensures proper module resolution.

2. **Use absolute imports**: Updated imports to use absolute paths from the project root:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   from api.schemas import APIResponse

   # Use
   from backend.api.schemas import APIResponse
   ```

## Environment Configuration

### Problem: Environment Variables and Paths

File paths and environment variables were configured differently between local development and production.

### Solution:

1. **Dynamic path resolution**: Updated `config.py` to handle different runtime environments
2. **Relative paths in production**: Configured file storage paths to be relative to the project root on Render

## Testing in Production

We recommend testing your backend services with a simple health check after deployment:

```bash
curl https://your-render-app.onrender.com/health
```

This should return a status of "ok" if the service is running correctly.

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
1. Verify all imports use absolute paths (`backend.module.file` instead of `module.file`)
2. Check that all type definitions are properly imported
3. Ensure environment variables are correctly set in the Render dashboard
4. Use the proper start command for Render deployments

Remember to review the [Render Deployment Guide](./RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete setup instructions.
