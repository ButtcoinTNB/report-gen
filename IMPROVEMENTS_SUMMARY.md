# Error Handling, API Documentation, and File Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the improvements made to the Insurance Report Generator application's error handling, API documentation, and file handling. These changes were implemented to enhance consistency, improve the developer experience, and make it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues.

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Custom Exception Hierarchy

We created a standardized exception hierarchy in `backend/utils/exceptions.py` to ensure consistent error responses across the application:

- `BaseAPIException`: Base class for all API exceptions, inherits from FastAPI's `HTTPException`
- Client error exceptions (4xx):
  - `NotFoundException`: For 404 errors when resources are not found
  - `ValidationException`: For 422 errors when request validation fails
  - `BadRequestException`: For 400 errors for general client errors
  - `AuthenticationException`: For 401 errors when authentication is required
  - `ForbiddenException`: For 403 errors when permission is denied
  - `ConflictException`: For 409 errors when a conflict occurs
  - `TooManyRequestsException`: For 429 errors when rate limits are exceeded
- Server error exceptions (5xx):
  - `InternalServerException`: For 500 errors for general server errors
  - `ServiceUnavailableException`: For 503 errors when services are unavailable
  - `GatewayTimeoutException`: For 504 errors when gateway timeouts occur
- Domain-specific exceptions:
  - `AIServiceException`: For errors related to AI service communication
  - `FileProcessingException`: For errors during file processing
  - `DatabaseException`: For database-related errors

Each exception provides a standardized format including:
- `status_code`: HTTP status code
- `code`: A machine-readable error code
- `message`: A human-readable error message
- `details`: Optional dictionary with additional error information

### 2. Error Handler Utility

We updated `backend/utils/error_handler.py` to work with the new exception classes:

- `handle_exception`: A function that standardizes error handling by converting common exceptions to our custom exceptions
- `api_error_handler`: A decorator for API endpoints that catches and handles exceptions
- `api_exception_handler`: A global exception handler for FastAPI to ensure consistent error responses

### 3. Global Exception Handling

We configured FastAPI to use our custom exception handlers in `backend/main.py`:

- Added custom handler for `RequestValidationError` to handle validation errors
- Registered our `api_exception_handler` for `BaseAPIException`

### 4. Request Logging Middleware

We implemented a request logging middleware in `backend/utils/middleware.py` to improve monitoring and debugging:

- Logs all requests with a unique ID for tracing
- Captures request method, path, client IP
- Measures and logs response time
- Adds request ID to response headers for end-to-end tracing

## API Documentation Improvements

### 1. Enhanced OpenAPI Schema

We created `backend/utils/openapi.py` to provide a customized OpenAPI schema with:

- Detailed API information including title, description, and contact details
- Security scheme definitions for future authentication
- Custom server information for different environments
- Improved error response schemas

### 2. Example Requests and Responses

We added `backend/api/openapi_examples.py` with example requests and responses for various endpoints:

- Example requests showing required and optional parameters
- Success response examples
- Error response examples showcasing our standardized error format
- Common error responses that apply to multiple endpoints

### 3. Integration with FastAPI

We updated `backend/main.py` to use our custom OpenAPI documentation:

```python
# Apply custom OpenAPI documentation
app.openapi = lambda: custom_openapi(app, ENDPOINT_EXAMPLES)
```

## File Handling Improvements

### 1. Enhanced FileProcessor Utility

We enhanced the `FileProcessor` class in `backend/utils/file_processor.py` to provide a centralized utility for all file-related operations:

- Comprehensive MIME type detection using multiple fallback methods
- Standardized file information format across the application
- Safe path handling to prevent path traversal attacks
- Text and image processing utilities

### 2. Chunked File Upload Support

We added support for chunked file uploads to handle large files more efficiently:

- `init_chunked_upload`: Creates metadata for a new chunked upload
- `save_chunk`: Handles individual chunk uploads
- `complete_chunked_upload`: Combines chunks into the final file
- `get_chunked_upload_status`: Provides status information for tracking
- `cleanup_chunked_upload`: Removes temporary chunk files

### 3. API Endpoint Updates for Chunked Uploads

We updated the upload API endpoints to use the enhanced FileProcessor:

- `POST /api/upload/chunked/init`: Initialize a new chunked upload
- `POST /api/upload/chunked/chunk/{upload_id}/{chunk_index}`: Upload a single chunk
- `POST /api/upload/chunked/complete`: Complete the chunked upload
- `GET /api/upload/chunked/status/{upload_id}`: Get upload status

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

We added test cases to verify the chunked upload functionality:

- Complete chunked upload flow testing
- Status tracking verification
- Cleanup operation testing
- Error handling verification

### 5. Documentation

We created `backend/docs/file_handling.md` with detailed documentation on:

- Basic usage examples
- Chunked upload flow
- API endpoint information
- Implementation details
- Future improvements

## API Endpoint Updates

We updated several key API endpoints to use our new standardized error handling:

1. `backend/api/generate.py`: Updated generation endpoints to use custom exceptions for:
   - Not found errors when reports or templates don't exist
   - Bad request errors for missing parameters
   - AI service errors when generation fails
   - Database errors when operations fail

2. `backend/api/upload.py`: Updated upload endpoints to use custom exceptions for:
   - Validation errors for file size and type validation
   - File processing errors when file operations fail
   - Database errors when storage operations fail

## Benefits

These improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: All API responses now follow a standardized format for both success and error cases.
2. **Detailed Error Information**: Error responses now include detailed information to help diagnose issues.
3. **Better Documentation**: The OpenAPI documentation now provides comprehensive information about endpoints, request formats, and possible responses.
4. **Improved Monitoring**: Request logging enables better tracking of API usage and performance.
5. **Simplified Error Handling**: Developers can catch specific exception types for more precise error handling.
6. **Better Developer Experience**: Consistent errors and clear documentation make the API easier to use and understand.
7. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Centralized file handling utilities eliminate duplicate code.
8. **Support for Large Files**: Chunked upload functionality allows handling files of any size.
9. **Enhanced Security**: Safe path handling prevents security vulnerabilities.

## Future Improvements

Additional improvements that could be made in the future:

1. Add rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
2. Implement more detailed request validation for specific endpoints
3. Add health check endpoints for monitoring
4. Implement API versioning
5. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
6. Database-backed upload tracking for better persistence
7. WebSocket-based progress events for real-time updates
8. Resumable upload support for better user experience
